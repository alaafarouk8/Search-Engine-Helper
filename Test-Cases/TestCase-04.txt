Moving energy is called kinetic energy.
anyway, kinetic energy is when your using energy that is moving.
kinetic energy - this is moving energy.
The two forms of energy are kinetic energy and potential energy.
Energy, once the energy is being used, the potential energy turns into *kinetic energy.
Potential energy is the energy of position and kinetic energy is the energy of motion.
The kinetic energy of an object is the energy it has because of its motion.
The first kind of energy is called kinetic energy.
All energy can be in one of two states:  potential energy or kinetic energy.
When the water starts to move, the potential energy becomes kinetic energy.
An object can have potential energy and no kinetic energy.
Mechanical energy is generally the kinetic energy of a system e.g. the energy it has when something moves.
Moving water and wind are examples of kinetic energy.
Not all moving objects have the same amount of kinetic energy.
A moving object has energy known as kinetic energy.
Although all moving objects have kinetic energy, not all moving objects have the same amount of kinetic energy.
While all moving objects have kinetic energy, not all moving objects have the same amount of kinetic energy.
Objects have kinetic energy because they are moving.
kinetic energy and potential energy.
Mechanical energy is the sum of two forms of energy: kinetic energy and potential energy.
Before potential energy can be used it is transferred into kinetic energy.
The water has energy, that is, kinetic energy, so, it has the ability to do work.
When potential energy and kinetic energy are combined it is called mechanical energy.
The gravitational potential energy of the water is converting to kinetic energy.
Interactions of Energy and Matter: All energy can be considered to be either kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.
When an object is moving, it has kinetic energy.
Potential energy can become kinetic and kinetic energy can become potential energy.
During energy transformations, potential energy is often transformed to kinetic energy and back again to potential energy.
There are two types of mechanical energy: potential energy and kinetic energy.
Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy.
Two common forms of energy are kinetic energy, which describes the energy in moving particles or objects, and potential energy, which describes the energy stored in objects at rest.
The change in velocity means that there is a change in the kinetic energy of the object.
There are two kinds of mechanical energy, namely kinetic energy and potential energy.
The two basic categories of energy are potential energy and kinetic energy.
Types of Energy There are two main types of energy used in society: potential energy and kinetic energy.
Flowing water and winds have kinetic energy.
Energy of motion is the energy an object possesses due to its motion, which is also called kinetic energy.
kinetic energy is energy that is already moving the law of conservation of energy allows us to equate potential energy with kinetic energy.
Quite often, potential energy changes to kinetic energy.
Speed and Kinetic Energy All moving objects have kinetic energy.
The energy of an object in motion is known as kinetic energy.
Mechanical energy can be either kinetic energy (energy of motion) or potential energy (stored energy of position).
Heat energy can only be kinetic, since it is energy of moving particles.
Electrical energy is a kind of kinetic energy.
The kinetic energy of an object is the energy which it possesses due to its motion.
When water falls downwards the potential energy changes into kinetic energy The kinetic energy in the moving water spins the generators and that’ll produce electrical energy 27.
Energy is also transferred from potential energy () to kinetic energy () and then back to potential energy constantly.
Only after an animal eats the plant is the potential energy from the sunlight released as kinetic energy for movement and growth.
Once energy is added to water by heat from the sun, the bonds between the water molecules gain kinetic energy, or energy in motion.
Internal energy is the sum of the potential energy of a system, and the kinetic energy of the system.
The energy associated with motion is called kinetic energy.
All energy forms could be set as two type of energy - potential and kinetic energy.
Potential energy can be converted into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy can be converted into potential energy.
potential energy can be converted into kinetic energy .
Energy can come in several forms, such as the kinetic energy that physically moves objects or the potential energy that is in the forces within or between the objects.
kinetic energy Energy associated with motion.
While kinetic energy is energy a body possesses because it is in motion.
Forms of Kinetic Energy MOTION A moving object has kinetic energy.
The change in the wheel’s kinetic energy is .
Energy exists in different forms, all of which can be classified as either potential energy or kinetic energy.
Energy generated due to the motion of a moving body is kinetic energy.
The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy.
