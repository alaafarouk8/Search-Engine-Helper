Boiling water is vaporization of water.
In water cycle.
A toaster changes electrical energy into heat energy.
Adult plants and animals  can have young.
Kinetic energy is the energy of movement.
Soil is a direct source of food and water for the plant.
Surface waters can be simply described as the water that is on the surface of the Earth.
Structures within a leaf convert the energy in sunlight into chemical energy that the plant can use as food.
Plants need food just as we and all living things do.
While all moving objects have kinetic energy, not all moving objects have the same amount of kinetic energy.
Objects have kinetic energy because they are moving.
Potential energy is the stored energy.
Heat energy from the sun is transfered to water bodies.
Plant and Animal Action- Animals also have an effect on rocks.
Any stored energy is potential energy.
An animal lives where it can find food, water, shelter and a mate.
The gardener can also move the plants.

Plants are producers.
Normal plants cant eat food thus they light to prepare food for themselves and for animals.
In some plants, water is taken in through open stomata.
Through the process of photosynthesis plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
Light is also a form of energy.
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.
Through photosynthesis, plants use the energy of light to put a meal together using water and carbon dioxide.
Water evaporates as water vapour into the air.
Plants make their own food through a process called photosynthesis.
The part of cells that plants use to make their own food are chloroplasts.
Cholesterol is made in the liver of animals and is found only in animal foods.
