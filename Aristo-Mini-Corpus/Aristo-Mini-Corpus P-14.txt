When fuels are burnt first of all chemical energy changes to heat energy and sometimes to light energy as well.
Animals need food, oxygen, and water to survive.
There is no change in the chemistry of water.. .
The object or material in which the energy changes form is called the energy converter or energy transducer.
The only way to change energy is if something does work on it.
Both plant and animal cells have many of the same organelles.
Many animals use their legs to move around.
Plants use sunlight as a way to make energy to grow.
Stored energy is called Potential Energy Stored energy is called Potential energy.
animals use the perspiration of water to cool down their bodies.
Like humans and animals, plants need both water and nutrients (food) to survive.
Potential energy is energy that has not yet been released.
Kinetic energy in the moving air is a source of energy called Wind Energy.
Ok well plants get eaten by animals.
Plant parts Plant Parts - Leaves Leaves are the food making factories of green plants.
The kinetic energy of an object is the energy it has because of its motion.
All animals and plants grow in size and shape.
Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their food.
Plants do not need oxygen.
Therefore all animals and all humans depend on plants for their survival.
Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to make food.
Students will explain that animals obtain energy from the plants and/or animals they eat.
au Animals and Plants need energy for growth and reproduction.
Plants also need nutrients to grow.
More from User Plants and animals depend on each other.
Plants use energy from the sun in tiny energy factories called chloroplasts.
Water and Nutrients Plant roots absorb water and some nutrients from the ground.
Water vapor is a by-product of respiration in plants and animals.
The name by which plants are known by non-botanists.
The majority of water on Earth is sea water.
